WordPress Foundation Theme
===================


Zurb's Foundation (http://foundation.zurb.com) in a WordPress theme.

FEATURES
________

We’ve built the WordPress Foundation theme so that it could be used as-is or as a starting point for theme developers. 
It’s based on v3.x of Zurb's Foundation.

Here’s what we’ve got so far. Watch this project on Github to keep up with some enhancements we’re developing.

Responsive

Foundation is responsive by nature.  This will look good on everything from mobile to desktop.

Page Templates
______________

We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.

    - Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site)
    - Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
    - Page with left sidebar
    - Full width page

Theme Options Panel
___________________

Want to change some colors? Do it all in our options panel.

Shortcodes
__________

We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Foundation.

Sidebars
________

We’ve built in two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to your heart’s content.



Originally forked from 320press/wordpress-foundation, but worked rudimentary, so we decided to create the repo new instead of a fork.
